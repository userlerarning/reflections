***What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
--R: A folder called .git is added to the directory and it will store the
commits
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
***How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
--R: It's intermediary directory where you can modify some files and then 
commit all of them in just one time
